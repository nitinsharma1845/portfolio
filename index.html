                            I have a solid understanding of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which forms the foundation of all web pages. I use semantic HTML tags to structure content clearly and accessibly, ensuring my websites are SEO-friendly and easy to maintain. From creating forms, tables, and navigation menus to organizing content with sections, articles, and headers, I apply best practices to build well-structured and standards-compliant web pages.

                            I am proficient in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and use it to create visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. I work with modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid to build structured and adaptable designs across devices. I also apply transitions, hover effects, and media queries to enhance user experience and ensure consistency. My approach focuses on clean design, proper use of class selectors, and maintaining a scalable CSS structure.

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                           I have a strong grasp of JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web applications. I use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, handle events, validate forms, and implement core logic on the client side. I’m comfortable using modern ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and async/await to write clean, efficient code.

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            I use React to build fast, scalable, and component-based user interfaces. I’m comfortable working with JSX, state management using useState and useEffect, and structuring applications using reusable components. I also understand routing with React Router and basic integration of external APIs. My focus is on building maintainable and responsive single-page applications (SPAs).

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                           Tailwind CSS is my go-to utility-first framework for rapidly styling modern and responsive user interfaces. I efficiently apply utility classes to create clean, mobile-first designs without writing custom CSS. I also use Tailwind’s responsive variants and dark mode support to deliver a consistent UI across all screen sizes.

                            I have hands-on experience working with both SQL and NoSQL databases. With MongoDB, I design flexible document-based schemas, perform CRUD operations, and connect with Node.js using Mongoose. With MySQL, I understand relational database concepts, write efficient queries using SQL, and manage structured data using tables, joins, and indexes. This combination allows me to choose the right database approach depending on project needs.
